Data from API fetch request returns an array of object and their attributes

    I need to create a file in which this data can be iterated through.
        in the iterations i need to create an instance of Anime.
        
        Given the instance of Anime i need to create a Card instance that is a prototype of the Anime Class.

            The Anime class saves all of the anime objects, and the Card class creates DOM elements for them.

            import Anime, Card and the Specific fetch request for the anime. (Seasonal, Trending, Top, ...)
